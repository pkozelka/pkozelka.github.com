## My coding projects

### [runjar](runjar/index.html)

* simple booter of runnable jars in all-in-one style
* tools to package dependencies of java applications into runnable jar
* support for packaging various app. types - standard, ant, war, ...

### [npmpack-maven-plugin](npmpack-maven-plugin/index.html)

* Integration of npm tooling into maven build.
* Counter NPM's tendency for instable builds with stable maven repository wrapping.

### [contentcheck-maven-plugin](contentcheck-maven-plugin/index.html)

* Protects WAR against harmful or legally problematic content.
* Keep archive content under explicit control
* Detect class conflicts among contained jars.

## Older stuff

* [args-inject](http://code.kozelka.net/args-inject/index.html)
  A commandline injection library - helps with commandline parsing tasks

* [Buildozer](http://code.kozelka.net/buildozer/index.html)
  Simplifies navigation and effective build in complex Maven projects.
  (has some issues with Maven 3, needs update)

* [Releasator](http://releasator.sourceforge.net/index.html)
  Adds much more automation to the Maven release process.
